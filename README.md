# Learning
Repo for notes and learning experiences through Colt Steele's Web Dev Course. 


This is a small project that I am forcing upon myself so that I can track my progress. This Repo and it's branches will follow me through my self taught learning experience.
It can also be used as a study tool and quick place to go to find something that i know ive seen before but cannot quite remember. As I go through and learn I will try and 
upload as much information in a somewhat organized manner.
