    <h3>
        List Elements
    </h3>
    <p>
        List consist of two types.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>unordered lists</li>
        <li>ordered lists</li>
    </ul>
    List are started with either an unordered list tag &lt;ul&gt;, or an ordered list tag &lt;ol&gt;. The items within
    the list are list items which are wrapped in a list item tag aka &lt;li&gt;. <br>
    each tag will need a closer &lt;ul&gt&lt;/ul&gt, &lt;ol&gt&lt;/ol&gt, &lt;li&gt&lt;/li&gt
    You can also embed lists within other lists like so.
    <ol>
        <li>a</li>
        <li>b</li>
        <ul>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>b</li>
        </ul>
        <li>c</li>

    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Paragraphs
    </h3>
    <p>Paragraphs are formed using the "&ltp&gt" tag and closed using the &lt/p&gt tag. <br>

    </p>
    <h3>
        Anchor tags
    </h3>
    <p>
        Anchor tags (&lta&gt) are used to make hyperlinks and "anchor" a document or webpage to a piece of text. This <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">LINK</a> will bring you to a page about anchor tags and how
        to use them.

    </p>
    <p>Here is a <a href="about.html">Link</a> to out about page. </p>

    <h3>
        Images!!
    </h3>
    <p>
        Next we learn about images(img). To add an image into you're HTML file you need to have a source or a file to
        refer to. This will be shown as src later down the line.<br>
        &ltimg (for image) src(source) ="(link to image here)"<br>
        alt (for screen readers)= "(words for screen readers to read usually something about the image itself)&gt
        <br>
        so in the grad scheme it'll look something like this: <br>
        <strong>&ltimg src = "randomimageofsomething.jpeg" <br>
            alt=" describe random image"&gt</strong>

    </p>
    <h3>
        Misc. Things to remember:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Somethings to remember include, <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b> elements. Such as <b>spans</b> and <b>divs</b>
        respectively. <br>
        a div is a block element that takes everything that is within the opening and closing tags and allows them to be
        stylized as a group. Almost creates a block around the elements to show they are grouped. <br>
        Spans work similarly to divs but are instead in line elements which means they still group but try to take up as
        little space as possible, imagine a grocery list ith highlighted elements. the highlighted elements would be the
        spans.
    </p>
    <p>
       <ul>
            <li>superscript makes the item raise off of the base line as follows <sup>Hello I am a superscript.
            </sup></li>
            <br>
            <li> subscript makes text fall below the base line as follows <sub>Hello I am a subscript.</sub>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Horizonal rule or &lt;hr&gr; creates a line across the page horizontally, will probably rarely be used
            but
            is as follows</li>
            <hr>
            <li>finally we have line breaks "&lt;br&gt;" which just jumps to the next line like<br>
            this.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Entity codes.</h4>
    <p>
        Entity codes are place holders for things in html that serve a purpose in the coding side of things such as &lt;
        and &gt;. Entity codes allow us to use special characters such as &#174; and &#9731; that are otherwise not
        available. <br>
        A few simple entity codes are &amplt; for the &lt; sign and &ampgt; for the &gt; sign also &amp;amp; for &amp;
