    <h1>
        Cascading Style Sheets!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now that we've covered a vast majority of html we will now be moving onto Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for
        short.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What is CSS?
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS is a language, not really a programming language but a language non the less. It allows us to make changes
        to HTML! CSS is a core component of most websites. Allowing us to move and color different things.
    </p>
    <p>
        The typical syntax for CSS or <b>RULES</b> look something like this:
    </p>
    <h3 id="syntax">
        selector {<br>
        property: value;<br>
        }<br>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Several examples of this are <br>
        h1{
        color:purple;
        } this allows us i make all h1s in our code the color purple.
        <br>
        img{
        width:200px;
        height:100px;
        }while this allows us to change the size of an image.<br>
        etc.
    </p>
    <p id="p1">
        Working now with text align. This doesnt not allow us to align the text on the page but rather it aligns it
        within the element. The h1, and h2 of this page are aligned to center. The only reason they are in the center of
        the page is because the element that they are confined in goes all the way across the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Font weight: font weight is the "boldness of the font" h1 comes with a already bolded font, and some fonts dont
        have access to some font weights, usually extra bold or extra thin. We have changed the font weight of the h1 on
        this page to normal(400).
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration" id="textdeco">Text decoration</a>:
        The appearence of certain text, underline overline, like through, etc. the h1 and h2 on this page have a text
        decoration of white underline.
    </p>
    <p>Something else that can be of good use is line height attribute. Allowing us to make things double spaced. like
        all the paragraphs on this page. Also the h1 in this page has a letter spacing of 15px.</p>

    <h3>
        Fonts and stuff!
    </h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size"> Font-size</a>: used to change the size of
        fonts. Kinda tricky becausse we have so many different units that measure the actual size of the fonts. <br>
        Pixels(aka) PX: most used absolute unit. 1 px does not necessarily equal the width of exactly one pixel on your
        machine! (not recommended for responsive websites).
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family">Font family</a>: This is how we change
        fonts. Now we cannot use every font, we have to use browser safe fonts, until we learn how to import our own
        fonts into webpages. Most of the time you will not see one font in code but rather a <b id="important">FONT
            STACK</b>, or a list of fonts we would like to use in order of how we would like to have them used.

    </p>
    <h3>
        Selectors!
    </h3>
    <p>
        Universal element selectors: (*) selects every single element.<br>
        Element selectors: (button, h1, h2, p, etc.)<br>
    <p>You can use a comma to select multiple things at once and give them the same styles. </p>
    ID selector: you can add an ID on to a single element and provide a hook, that way we can select it in CSS and give it an exact stlye without ruining the style of anything else.
